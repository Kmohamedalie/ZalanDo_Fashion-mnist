# **Fashion Mnist**
[Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

## Purpose Fashion-MNIST

The original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. *"If it doesn't work on MNIST, it **won't work** at all"*, they said. *"Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."*
